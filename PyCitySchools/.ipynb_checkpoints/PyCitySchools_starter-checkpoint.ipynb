    "## Observation 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The first observation is that the amount spent per student is not an indicator of how well the students perform in math and reading.  The data displayed under School Summary section shows that the top performing schools generally have lower cost per student than the lower performing schools.  Specifically, Cabrera High School is the top performer based on Overall Passing Rate but has a lower cost per student than all of the bottom five performers.  This is further illustrated by the table in section Scores by School Spending.  That data shows that the lowest spending schools are producing the best overall passing scores.  Based on this, more money does not produce better students.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observation 2\n",
    "The second observation is that school size has a major role in student scores.  The top five performing schools have half the number of students than the bottom five performing schools.  With a difference on Overall Passing Scores of approximately 22 points, the size of the school plays a significant role in student performance.   \n"
